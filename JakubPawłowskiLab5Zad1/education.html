        <p>
            The reaction distance is the distance you travel from the point of detecting a hazard until you begin braking or swerving.

            The reaction distance is affected by
            The car’s speed (proportional increase):
            2 x higher speed = 2 x longer reaction distance.
            5 x higher speed = 5 x longer reaction distance.
            <h5>Reaction time</h5>
            Normally 0.5–2 seconds.
            45–54 year-olds have the best reaction time in traffic.
            18–24 year-olds and those over 60 have the same reaction time in traffic. Young people have sharper senses but older people have more experience.
            The reaction distance can be decreased by
            Anticipation of hazards.
            Preparedness.
            The reaction distance can be increased by
            The necessity of decision-making (for example, between braking or steering out of the way).
            Alcohol, drugs and medication.
            Tiredness.

        <h2>Braking distance</h2>
        <p>
            The braking distance is the distance the car travels from the point when you start braking until the car stands still.
            The braking distance is affected by
            The vehicle’s speed (quadratic increase; “raised to the power of 2”):
            2 x higher speed = 4 x longer braking distance.
            3 x higher speed = 9 x longer braking distance.
            The road (gradient and conditions).
            The load.
            The brakes (condition, braking technology and how many wheels are braking).
            Calculate the braking distance
            It is very difficult to achieve reliable calculations of the braking distance as road conditions and the tyres’ grip can vary greatly. The braking distance may for example be 10 times longer when there is ice on the road.
